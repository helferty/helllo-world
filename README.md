# hello-world
Just another repository. I will use this for many projects such using KiCad , Fusion 360, Atmel and many others. I teach Computer Engineering and really enjoy embedded systems with applications to robotics, high altitude ballooning, design and flight of sub-orbital payloads and drones.
